I am a Bus, not physically, but in my heart.

I like to Mame, not because it's in my heart, because it's fun.

My code represents those of whom I mame, due to the fact that it's a disorganised and disgusting 
mess of something which does not look like it should, primarily as a result of my actions.

Do no contact me. For if you do, my fate will become your own.

Also, I know that's not how you spell maime. I wasn't aware when I came up with the username, and for sentimental
reasons, I dare not correct it.
